This directory contains examples of detection CSV files created by
various versions of BirdVoxDetect. Each of the files was created by
running BirdVoxDetect on an hour-long test file named
"Ithaca_20xx-10-03_06.00.00_Z.wav" (where "xx" is a year number)
from the Vesper Tutorial. I used the example CSV files as a guide
in developing the code in the "run_birdvoxdetect" script that parses
BirdVoxDetect output.
