This directory contains examples of detection CSV files created by
various versions of BirdVoxDetect. The files were created by running
various versions of BirdVoxDetect on an hour-long test file named
"Ithaca_2019-10-03_06.00.00_Z.wav". That file came from the Vesper
Tutorial. I used the example CSV files as a guide in developing the
code in the "run_birdvoxdetect" script that parses BirdVoxDetect
output.
